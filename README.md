# Image Library Image Access

The problem: Core image library - the dialog to browse files previously
uploaded to Backdrop - is an all-or-nothing item.

You can access all files, regardless who previously uploaded them. This is
fine for small websites with only few users (and roles). This is a pain
point, though, if different roles should have different levels of access to
existing images.

This module provides an extra permission to access all the images in the
image library - other roles (accounts) will only see *their own files*.
